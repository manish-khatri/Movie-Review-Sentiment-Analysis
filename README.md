### Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
I did a machine learning project on sentiment analysis of the movie review. I tried to make a web application out of it that takes an English text and predicts the sentiment of the text. In the project, I used other features as well, but for this web application, I just trained my model on "review text", which gave a decent accuracy of 82%, i.e., out of 100 reviews, the model will correctly predict the sentiment of 82 reviews.
I used the streamlit library to create the web application.
